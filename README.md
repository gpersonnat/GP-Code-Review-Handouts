# CS51 2024 Code Review [Personnat]

This repository contains problems that I will be covering during code reviews for the 2024 edition of CS51. The repository contains several folders labeled `cr{n}` which correspond to the files that will be used for the nth code review. The source code will be written in `cr{n}.ml` and `cr{n}_tests.ml` will contain unit tests. Solutions will be posted after code review under the file `cr{n}_soln.ml`. 

Problems were written by Jayden and Gerson Personnat and many were inspired by 
the CS51 Textbook *Programming Well* by Stuart Shieber, [OCaml's 99 Famous Problems](https://v2.ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html), and Cornell's University 
CS 3110 textbook *OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful*. 

If you have any questions or spot any corrections to be made to the problem, 
email me (jpersonnat@college.harvard.edu) or create a GitHub Issue.
