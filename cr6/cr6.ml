(* 
Define a function mem_factorial which takes a unit as an argument and returns 1 the first
time it is called, returns 2 the second time it is called, returns 6 the third time it is called, and
so on. In general, the function should return n! on the nth time it is called.

(* Define a function that generates the Fibonacci numbers (i.e. fib(i) the ith time the function
is called *)
let fib _ = failwith "not implemented" ;;


(* Rewrite power from Part 2 (see Problem 6) to improve the worst-case time complexity. 
What is the asymptotic runtime of the function right now? *)
